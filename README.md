# Jailbreak-Documentation-iOS
An archive of various writeups and documentation for miscellaneous jailbreak tools and techniques. This will likely be extremely useful for aspiring devs like me.

A lot of the info contained here is just miscellaneous tricks for jailbreak stuff that I personally couldn't find documentation on, so I decided to document on my own.
